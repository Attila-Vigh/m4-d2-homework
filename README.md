# M4-D2-HOMEWORK

## Create your first React App!
> In this exercise you are going to create your own book store by using React Components!

1. Use the create-react-app boilerplate to create your new React application
2. Install and set up bootstrap + react-bootstrap in your app
3. Create a MyNav component which will render a bootstrap navigation bar with the following links: Home,    About and Browse. Note: we don't know how to perform navigation yet, so for now just put "#" as the href for each one on them
4. Create a MyFooter component which will render a footer for the page
5. Create a Welcome component with a Jumbotron and a subtitle for your shop
6. Create a Latest Release component. This component should read from one of the json files and print out the cover of the books
